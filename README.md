# XMPPChat-iOS

Getting started using XMPPFramework on iOS
=================
An XMPP Framework in Objective-C for the iOS development community.

Introduction

The project comes with a sample Xcode project demonstrating running XMPPFramework on iOS. This is not designed to be a full fledged application. It simply serves to show the potential of the framework as well as providing a concrete example of using the code on the iOS platform. Feel free to play with the project, and browse the AppDelegate code. Keep in mind that this sample project only makes use of a small portion of available functionality.

XMPPFramework provides a core implementation of RFC-3920 (the xmpp standard), along with the tools needed to read & write XML. It comes with multiple popular extensions (XEP's), all built atop a modular architecture, allowing you to plug-in any code needed for the job. Additionally the framework is massively parallel and thread-safe. Structured using GCD, this framework performs well regardless of whether it's being run on an old iPhone, or iPad. (And it won't block the main thread... at all)

Cost
