# XMPPChat-iOS
=================

An XMPP Framework in Objective-C for the iOS development community.

XMPPFramework provides a core implementation of RFC-3920 (the xmpp standard), along with the tools needed to read & write XML. It comes with multiple popular extensions (XEP's), all built atop a modular architecture, allowing you to plug-in any code needed for the job. Additionally the framework is massively parallel and thread-safe. Structured using GCD, this framework performs well regardless of whether it's being run on an old iPhone, or iPad. (And it won't block the main thread... at all)
